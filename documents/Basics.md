# Treasure Hunt Builder



## Basic Format

12 Bases
4 teams

Prevent base skipping
by requiring clues from multiple bases to continue
hiding clues in very concealed places so that only a detailed clue will reveal location.

Use cards with missing spaces to enable multiple teams to use same clues in a different order. preventing teams from following one another.

For long trips provide riddles and codes to be solved on the way.
